When I first decided to put add a blog to my website, I ran straight to [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org) and jumped through all the necessary hoops I needed to get it up and running. WordPress is an amazing tool, but my needs were much too simplistic. Soon I started thinking that the full-featured tool was actually getting in the way of me putting out content.

Eventually (I think via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)) I stumbled across [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I started [configuring](/blog/github-pages-jekyll-mavericks/) my development environment, [configuring](/blog/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) my domain, and redesigning my website to my liking. Blog posts came out pretty steadily and easily at first while I was adding features and making changes to my website, but eventually I ran out of content.

Recently, I've been doing some WordPress work and it inspired me to take on a WordPress project of my own, but this time around I really wanted to get it right. My first stop (after having been there for the original work multiple times) was the [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org).

I've always thought that the first post in a blog is [awkward](http://michaeljdeeb.com/blog/migrated-guide-to-getting-started/) (I even mention how difficult it is to get started in that linked post). I think that most of this difficulty and awkwardness came about because I didn't really do any planning at the beginning. Since this is a personal site, I thought I would just post about whatever I felt like. You can do that, but it can be really overwhelming to come up with content when you don't have any focus.

The WordPress Codex has an entry called, ["First Steps With WordPress"](https://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress) and it has a section called, ["Planning Session"](https://codex.wordpress.org/First_Steps_With_WordPress#Planning_Session) that walks you through six important questions to help you frame your blog a bit more. I'll post the questions here, but I definitely recommend clicking through for the rest of the planning exercise.

1. What am I going to do with this?
2. Who is going to read this?
3. What kinds of information will I be posting?
4. Why am I doing this?
5. Who am I doing this for?
6. How often am I going to be posting and adding information?

I'd also write everything out on paper like they suggest. I kept crossing things out or going back to reword bullet points as I went along. I'm hoping that this planning can get me back on track with regular posting now that I have a much clearer idea of what I would like to write about.

It's funny how we always end up coming full circle, even in technology.
