When I purchased my domain name three years ago, I wanted to use it as a spot to house creations and ideas. Needless to say, neither of those goals were attained.

It essentially served as a networking hub where people could choose their preferred method of contact (Email, [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljdeeb/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaeljdeeb), etc.) and as an appropriate place to house a full list of the classes I took during my undergrad.

I tried hosted solutions like [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com), but the UX wasn't consistent between my blog and the rest of my site. Then, I tried rolling my own copy of WordPress last year, but that didn't stick either. This is the solution I've been looking for.

Stay tuned for the struggle of configuring it. I plan to run this website/blog with agility, so if you're seeing a webpage that looks like it belongs to the beginning of the Internet, I apologize. The best I can offer you is that I'm working on it.

Feedback is great and I love to have flaws in my posts correct, but when I had WordPress installed on my server the blog comments were pretty spammy. I think I'm going to try something different this time around and hope that it sticks.
